A repo for my paper on measuring coolness as a distributed property.<br/>
I am proud of my work here, it was creative, and it could have good applications in the data science world.<br/>
David Kenny, whose analytic model I adapted, said that it proved something he'd long thought true but never shown.

Note 1: These analyses were done in a stand-alone program (SoReMo) and not R, that was how people were doing SRM at the time. The field (and I) have since switched to an MLM approach. <br/>
Note 2: I am proud of the work, but I take responsibility for the poorly written paper.
